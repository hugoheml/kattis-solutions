# Kattis Solutions in Rust  

This repository was created as part of a course on algorithmic quality. The goal was to solve various problems on the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) platform.  

All solutions were implemented in Rust, as it was the required programming language for this assignment.  

Feel free to explore the code and see how the problems were tackled!
